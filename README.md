# DFV_THESIS_DOCUMENTS
These documents were created as part of the submission of an undergraduate thesis to the Oregon State University Honors College. They detail the design of a Rapid Prototyping Test Stand (RPTS) designed to quicken the development of an electric propellant feed pump for a bi-propellant liquid engine rocket for the HALE student rocketry team.
